Plant diseases pose a serious challenge to global food security and agricultural productivity. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that plant diseases cause 10-16% of crop losses every year, affecting the livelihoods of millions of farmers and the food security of billions of people. To prevent crop losses and reduce the use of harmful pesticides, it is essential to detect plant diseases early and accurately. However, the traditional methods of plant disease detection, such as visual inspection, laboratory testing, and expert consultation, are often slow, expensive, and unreliable. Therefore, there is a need for fast, reliable, and low-cost methods of plant disease detection that can be easily deployed and used by farmers and researchers. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful technique for solving various problems in computer vision, such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can learn complex and high-level features from large amounts of data and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various vision tasks. However, applying deep learning to plant disease detection poses several challenges, such as the scarcity and diversity of plant disease images, the variability and complexity of plant disease symptoms, and the generalization and robustness of the models. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach for plant disease detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use a large and diverse dataset of plant images with different diseases and augment it with various image transformations. We design and train a CNN model that can classify plant images into 38 disease categories with high accuracy. This paper demonstrates the potential of deep learning for plant disease detection and provides a useful tool for farmers and researchers.
